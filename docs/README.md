# Automation Dashboard Architecture Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive architectural documentation for the Automation Dashboard project, an Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) reporting and analytics system.

## Documentation Index

2. **[Data Synchronization Architecture](02-data-sync-architecture.md)** - AAP data sync processes and background workers
3. **[Analytics and Reporting Architecture](03-analytics-reporting.md)** - Report generation, cost analysis, and data visualization
4. **[API Architecture](04-api-architecture.md)** - REST API structure and endpoints
5. **[Frontend Architecture](05-frontend-architecture.md)** - React application structure and data flow
6. **[Database Schema](06-database-schema.md)** - Data models and relationships
7. **[Deployment Architecture](07-deployment-architecture.md)** - Container deployment and infrastructure
8. **[Security Architecture](08-security-architecture.md)** - Authentication, authorization, and data protection

## Quick Reference

### Key Technologies
- **Backend**: Django 4.2 + REST Framework + PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + PatternFly + Redux Toolkit
- **Background Workers**: dramatiq dispatcher system
- **Deployment**: Docker containers with Ansible installer
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 integration with AAP clusters

### Core Concepts
- **Clusters**: AAP installations that provide job data
- **Data Synchronization**: Background sync of job data from AAP APIs
- **Cost Analytics**: Manual vs automated execution cost analysis
- **Reports**: Interactive dashboards with filtering and export capabilities

### Architecture Principles
- Separation of data ingestion (sync) from reporting (analytics)
- Asynchronous background processing for data updates
- Stateless frontend with centralized state management
- OAuth2 security for cluster authentication
- Containerized deployment for scalability
